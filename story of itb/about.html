					<p>President's Welcome
						Taking the Next Step in Education

						The alliance of Institute of Technology Blanchardstown, Dublin Institute of Technology, and Institute of Technology Tallaght is set to become the first Technological University (TU Dublin) in Ireland, as revealed by An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar TD in July 2018.

						TU Dublin will be positioned at the convergence of the arts, business, science and technology, and will strengthen the Greater Dublin Region and its prominence as a location that encourages and supports knowledge advancement, sustainable development and inclusive education.

						Technological Universities are an established feature of many international educational systems in Germany, Austria, Finland, the Netherlands, Canada and New Zealand, acting as a dynamic catalyst for economic, technological, social and cultural progress.

						TU Dublin will comprise a joined-up approach to the third-level experience that involves connecting students, employers, researchers and the wider academic community to facilitate economic transformation and sustainable growth. I look forward to the establishment of the pioneering TU Dublin, where our students, staff and partners will connect with academic programmes to create Ireland’s skilled graduates of tomorrow.

						Our campus continues to grow, our new dedicated Student Services building will be up and running by the time you join us in 2019.

						We look forward to you joining us on the Blanchardstown Campus of TU Dublin.

						Dr. Diarmuid O’Callaghan,

						President</p>

			<p>Education Policy
Approach to Education
ITB will provide a flexible third-level programme designed to meet regional and national requirements with an emphasis on:

specialist higher education for leading-edge industries in the region,
upgrading of specialist technical/technological skills,
continuing education and the needs of mature students,
in-service courses, retraining and updating of skills,
special needs arising from educational disadvantage or disability.
The learning strategy of the Institute is aimed at guiding students towards the levels of knowledge and skills acquisition for an evolving working life. Inherent in this approach is the essential attitudinal development for increasing motivation and for promoting self-management, critical analysis, decision-making, problem solving and entrepreneurship.

The Institute is providing education and training that is relevant and responsive to economic and social needs both locally and nationally. It is designing and delivering a range of high-quality courses for full- time and part-time students. The courses aim to produce graduates who can meet the human resource requirements of leading-edge, high-technology industries.

The Institute's courses are designed in such a way that they are made available to a wide range of students in a flexible way. Flexibility in the provision of courses includes co-operative education, work experience, modularisation and credit accumulation.

Commitment to Lifelong Learning
The Institute is committed to lifelong learning and second-chance education and has developed an active adult continuing education programme. The learning strategy is aimed at guiding students towards the levels of knowledge and skills acquisition for an evolving working life. Inherent in this approach is the essential attitudinal development for increasing motivation and for promoting self- management, critical analysis, decision-making, problem solving and entrepreneurship.

Commitment to the Community
In line with its commitment to community service, the Institute is developing close links with schools and other educational institutions, community and development organisations and industrial and commercial interests. These links will encourage students to progress from second to third level and will help them to make a successful transition from the Institute to other educational institutions or to employment.
