				<p><h2><strong>Local Industry</strong></h2></p>
				
				<br>
			<p>The development of local industry and business around the college campus and the Blanchardstown area. <br><br>
				<div class="image"><img src="images/itbmap.jpg" width="500"  alt="itbmap"></div>
			The Blue line indicates the Blanchardstown corporate park facility which stretches over 100 acres with 75% of the campus being developed <br>over the past 20 years. The red outline is the location of the ITB campus to give perspective to the size of the park.<br>
			<i>“Blanchardstown Corporate Park is located in the heart of The Dublin Enterprise Zone. The Dublin Enterprise Zone<br> consists of 1571 hectares of land primarily zoned for Office, Research and Development, High Technology<br> Manufacturing, Industrial, General Enterprise and Employment located seven kilometres northwest of the city centre.”</i><br>
			<strong>Extract Taken from the http://corporatepark.ie/ website.</strong><br>The complex is split into two parks and is home to huge businesses <br>such as Nike, Puma, Bank of Ireland and Bristol-Myers Squibb to name a few.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>Another more well-known business development in the area is The Blanchardstown Shopping Centre. With over 180 retail stores, restaurants,<br> cafes and a 9-screen cinema spread over 3 retail parks and some huge businesses such as Liberty insurance and eBay having offices here,<br> its easy to see why Blanchardstown is known for its shopping centre. The main development was opened in 1996 and has grown to have over <br>15 million visitors a year with over 30 million website visits a year.</p>
